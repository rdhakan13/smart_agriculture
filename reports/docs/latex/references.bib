  abstract       = {As a result of the development of non-invasive optical spectroscopy, the number of prospective technologies of plant monitoring is growing. Being implemented in devices with different functions and hardware, these technologies are increasingly using the most advanced data processing algorithms, including machine learning and more available computing power each time. Optical spectroscopy is widely used to evaluate plant tissues, diagnose crops, and study the response of plants to biotic and abiotic stress. Spectral methods can also assist in remote and non-invasive assessment of the physiology of photosynthetic biofilms and the impact of plant species on biodiversity and ecosystem stability. The emergence of high-throughput technologies for plant phenotyping and the accompanying need for methods for rapid and non-contact assessment of plant productivity has generated renewed interest in the application of optical spectroscopy in fundamental plant sciences and agriculture. In this perspective paper, starting with a brief overview of the scientific and technological backgrounds of optical spectroscopy and current mainstream techniques and applications, we foresee the future development of this family of optical spectroscopic methodologies.},

  abstract = {Background
Due to their high protein content, nuts (almond, walnut, and pistachio) are among the main substitutes for meat, with a growing share of the food basket in the United States. However, the rapidly growing acreage of these crops, new legislations, the necessity of minimizing the environmental footprint, and a cost-effective production demand certain managerial practices based on precision agriculture and remote sensing, which have shown promising results in food production.
Scope and approach
This paper presents a comprehensive review of remote sensing platforms, sensors, applications, and analytic pipelines with a focus on nut crops, even though the materials are applicable for other specialty crops. In this regard, the paper is divided into five main sections: First, the problems and potential solutions are elaborated in the introduction. Second, the available platforms: satellites, manned aircraft, and UASs are discussed. Then the sensors used for remote sensing, their working principle, and the pros and cons of each are presented. Next, practiced and suggested applications of remote sensing data are reviewed. Finally, data processing and analytics needed to produce and interpret reliable results are highlighted.
Key findings and conclusions
Key findings are listed as: 1) The acreage of the nut orchards and the purpose of the studies determine the fitting sensor and platform. 2) Although various sensors are available and reported to have promising results in other crops, they have not been used for nut crops. 3) Accurate sensor calibration is crucial for repeatable results as well as temporal and inter-field comparisons. 4) Except for water management, most remote sensing applications are limitedly studied in nut orchards, creating some research opportunities. 5) Finally, increasing data size requires new machine learning techniques and data fusion frameworks to handle all variables and fill the knowledge gap.},

  abstract = {Tissue testing used to assess the chemical contents in potato plants is considered laborious, time-consuming, destructive, and expensive. Ground-based sensors have been assessed to provide efficient information on nitrogen using leaf canopy reflectance. In potatoes, however, the main organ required for tissue testing is the petiole to estimate the elements of all nutrients. This research aims to assess whether there is a correlation between the chemical contents of potato petioles and leaf spectrum, and to examine whether the spectrum of dried or fresh leaves have higher correlation values. Petiole chemical contents of all elements were tested as a reference point. Leaves were split equally into dried and fresh groups for spectral analysis (400–2500 nm). Lasso Regression models were built to estimate concentrations in comparison to actual values. The performances of the model were tested using the Ratio of (standard error of) Prediction to (standard) Deviation (RPD). All elements showed reasonable to excellent RPD values except for sodium. All elements showed higher correlation in the dried testing mode except for nitrogen and potassium. The models showed that the most significant wavebands were in the visible and very near infrared range (400–1100 nm) for all macronutrients except magnesium and sulfur, while all micronutrients had the most significant wavebands in full range (400–2500 nm) with a common significant waveband at 1932 nm. The results show high potentials of a new approach to estimate potato plant elements based on foliar spectral reflectance.},

With streaming data, information is constantly being updated and a major statistical challenge for these types of data is that the underlying distribution and the true input–output dependency might change over time, a phenomenon known as concept drift. The concept drift phenomenon makes the learning process complicated because a predictive model constructed on the past data is no longer consistent with new examples. In order to effectively track concept drift, we propose model-combining methods using constrained and penalized regression that possesses a grouping property. The new learning methods enable us to select data batches as a group that are relevant to the current one, reduce the effects of irrelevant batches, and adaptively reflect the degree of concept drift emerging in data streams. We demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method using simulated and real examples. The analytical and empirical results indicate that the proposed methods can effectively adapt to various types of concept drift.},

We applied these revised network architectures to three publicly available data sets and the resulting calibration models can generate acceptable results for general quantitative analysis. It also generated rather good results for data sets that concern calibration transfer.

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can be used to estimate kernel composition, but models trained on a few environments may underestimate error rates and bias. We assembled corn samples from diverse international environments and used NIR with chemometrics and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine moisture and protein. The potential of five feature selection methods to improve prediction accuracy was assessed by extracting sensitive wavelengths. Gradient boosting machines (GBMs), particularly CatBoost and LightGBM, were found to effectively select crucial wavelengths for moisture (1409, 1900, 1908, 1932, 1953, 2174 nm) and protein (887, 1212, 1705, 1891, 2097, 2456 nm).

  abstract = {Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in combination with partial least-squares regression (PLS) is widely applied in process control for non-destructive measurement of quality parameters during production. PLS assumes an approximate linear relationship between the parameter to be estimated and the intensity of its absorption bands. Spectra, however, may contain non-linearities for various reasons such as differences in viscosity, temperature, pH, particle size and chemical composition of the sample matrix. In such cases, PLS might not predict the parameter of interest sufficiently well, and one must find other methods for the calibration task. Support vector machine regression (SVR) has been gaining interest within chemometrics in recent years. SVR is capable of modelling highly non-linear data, also when data are of very high dimensions. The aim of this study was to develop calibration models of NIR spectra from four different process steps in a raw-sugar factory. The models were intended for monitoring two quality parameters at the individual process steps. Our goal was to obtain global calibration models covering all four process steps in order to obtain simple calibration maintenance. SVR was used for the calibration task, since all of the above-mentioned sources of non-linearities were present. SVR results were benchmarked against PLS. SVR had a better prediction performance than PLS (1) for models built on individual process steps, (2) for global models covering all four process steps and (3) when the global models were evaluated on the individual process steps. Moreover, the majority of SVR models had prediction errors close to reference uncertainty and hence were close to being optimal. Finally, the global SVR models predicted the individual process steps better than the corresponding local PLS models. We conclude that the nonlinear modelling method SVR was able to model non-linearities caused by pooling NIR spectra from multiple different process steps. Implementation of the global SVR models would have several advantages over the local PLS models. First, they would allow simple calibration maintenance because only one model per quality parameter would have to be maintained. Second, they would allow more precise estimation of the quality parameters and therefore better process monitoring.},

  abstract = {Traditionally multivariate calibration models have been developed using regression based techniques including principal component regression and partial least squares and their non-linear counterparts. This paper proposes the application of Gaussian process regression as an alternative method for the development of a calibration model. By formulating the regression problem in a probabilistic framework, a Gaussian process is derived from the perspective of Bayesian non-parametric regression, prior to describing its implementation using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The flexibility of a Gaussian process, in terms of the parameterization of the covariance function, results in its good performance in terms of the development of a calibration model for both linear and non-linear data sets. To handle the high dimensionality of spectral data, principal component analysis is initially performed on the data, followed by the application of Gaussian process regression to the scores of the extracted principal components. In this sense, the proposed method is a non-linear variant of principal component regression. The effectiveness of the Gaussian process approach for the development of a calibration model is demonstrated through its application to two spectroscopic data sets. A statistical hypothesis test procedure, the paired t-test, is used to undertake an empirical comparison of the Gaussian process approach with conventional calibration techniques, and it is concluded that the Gaussian process exhibits enhanced behaviour.},

  abstract = {Internal qualities of navel oranges are the key factors for their market value and of major concern to customers. Unlike traditional subjective quality assessment, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy based techniques are quantitative, convenient and non-destructive. Various machine learning methods have been applied to NIR spectra analysis to determine the fruit qualities. NIR spectra are usually of very high dimension. Explicit or implicit variable selection is essential to ensure prediction performance. Least angle regression (LAR) is a relatively new and efficient machine learning algorithm for regression analysis and is good for variable selection. We investigate the potential of the LAR algorithm for NIR spectra analysis to determine the internal qualities of navel oranges. A total of 1535 navel orange samples from 15 origins were prepared for NIR spectra collection and quality parameters measurement. Spectra are of 1500 dimensions with wavelengths ranging from 1000 nm to 2499 nm. The LAR was compared with the most widely used linear and nonlinear methods in three aspects: prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and model interpretability. The results showed that the prediction performance of LAR was better than that of PLS, while slightly inferior to that of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). LAR was computationally more efficient than both PLS and LS-SVM. By concentrating on the most important predictors, LAR is much easier to reveal the most relevant predictors than PLS; LS-SVM was hardly interpretable because of its nonlinear kernel.},

Besides modeling positive task correlation, our method, called multi-task relationship learning (MTRL), can also describe negative task correlation and identify outlier tasks based on the same underlying principle. Under this regularization framework, the objective function of MTRL is convex. For efficiency, we use an alternating method to learn the optimal model parameters for each task as well as the relationships between tasks. We study MTRL in the symmetric multi-task learning setting and then generalize it to the asymmetric setting as well. We also study the relationships between MTRL and some existing multi-task learning methods. Experiments conducted on a toy problem as well as several benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MTRL.},

  abstract = {Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an analytical technology widely used for the non-destructive characterisation of organic samples, considering both qualitative and quantitative attributes. In the present study, the combination of Multi-target (MT) prediction approaches and Machine Learning algorithms has been evaluated as an effective strategy to improve prediction performances of NIR data from wheat flour samples. Three different Multi-target approaches have been tested: Multi-target Regressor Stacking (MTRS), Ensemble of Regressor Chains (ERC) and Deep Structure for Tracking Asynchronous Regressor Stack (DSTARS). Each one of these techniques has been tested with different regression methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Linear Regression (LR), on a dataset composed of NIR spectra of bread wheat flours for the prediction of quality-related parameters. By combining all MT techniques and predictors, we obtained an improvement up to 7% in predictive performance, compared with the corresponding Single-target (ST) approaches. The results support the potential advantage of MT techniques over ST techniques for analysing NIR spectra.},

  abstract = {Spectral preprocessing techniques can, to a certain extent, eliminate irrelevant information, such as current noise and stray light from spectral data, thereby enhancing the performance of prediction models. However, current preprocessing techniques mostly attempt to find the best single preprocessing method or their combination, overlooking the complementary information among different preprocessing methods. These preprocessing techniques fail to maximize the utilization of useful information in spectral data and restrict the performance of prediction models. This study proposed a spectral ensemble preprocessing method based on the rapidly developing ensemble learning methods in recent years and the ridge regression (RR) model, named stacking preprocessing ridge regression (SPRR), to address the aforementioned issues. Different from conventional ensemble learning methods, the proposed SPRR method applied multiple different preprocessing techniques to the original spectral data, generating multiple preprocessed datasets. These datasets were then individually inputted into RR base models for training. Ultimately, RR still served as the meta-model, integrating the output results of each RR base model through stacking. This approach not only produced diversity in base models but also achieved higher accuracy and lower computational complexity by using a single type of base model. On the apple spectral dataset collected by our team, correlation analysis showed significant complementary information among the data produced by different preprocessing techniques. This provided robust theoretical support for the proposed SPRR method. By introducing the currently popular averaging ensemble preprocessing method in a comparative experiment, the results of applying the proposed SPRR method to six datasets (apple, meat, wheat, olive oil, tablet, and corn) demonstrated that compared to the single preprocessing method and averaging ensemble preprocessing method, SPRR yielded the best accuracy and reliability for all six datasets. Furthermore, under the same conditions of the training and test datasets, the proposed SPRR method demonstrated better performance than the four commonly used ensemble preprocessing methods.},

  abstract = {Precision Agriculture (PA) can help in managing crop production inputs in an environmentally friendly way. By using site-specific knowledge, PA can target rates of fertilizer, seed and chemicals for soil and other conditions. PA substitutes information and knowledge for physical inputs. A literature review indicates PA can contribute in many ways to long-term sustainability of production agriculture, confirming the intuitive idea that PA should reduce environmental loading by applying fertilizers and pesticides only where they are needed, and when they are needed. Precision agriculture benefits to the environment come from more targeted use of inputs that reduce losses from excess applications and from reduction of losses due to nutrient imbalances, weed escapes, insect damage, etc. Other benefits include a reduction in pesticide resistance development. One limitation of the papers reviewed is that only a few actually measured directly environmental indices, such as leaching with the use of soil sensors. Most of them estimated indirectly the environmental benefits by measuring the reduced chemical loading. Results from an on-farm trial in Argentina provide an example of how site-specific information and variable rate application could be used in maintaining profitability while reducing N applications. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that PA is a modestly more profitable alternative than whole field management, for a wide range of restrictions on N application levels. These restrictions might be government regulations or the landowner's understanding of environmental stewardship. In the example, variable rate of N maintains farm profitability even when nitrogen is restricted to less than half of the recommended uniform rate.},

  abstract = {The term ‘quality’ is a complex parameter in the field of potato production, and the desired quality traits depend on the intended use. Important internal quality traits for potatoes are tuber flesh discolouration, dry matter, and starch content. External quality traits include tuber size and shape as well as resistance against mechanical stress during and after harvest. These quality traits are closely interrelated and genetically controlled. It has been demonstrated that all these parameters are also linked to the nutrient status of the plant and/or the tubers. For instance, the susceptibility of tubers for discolouration of both fresh market and processed cultivars is closely related not only to the nutrient supply but also to post-harvest treatment. Besides, the potential to form carcinogenic compounds like acrylamide from precursors during the deep-frying of potato products and the accumulation of toxic substances like glycoalkaloids are important quality criteria in terms of food safety. The influence of the supply of nutrients on potato tuber quality depends initially on their physiological functions, but the ratio to other nutrient needs should also be taken into account.},

  abstract  = {The efficient use of nutrients by plants can significantly improve the economic profitability and environmental sustainability of agricultural enterprises. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can provide a real-time, rapid, and non-destructive crop nutrient monitoring method to improve the timing of plant nutrient delivery. This review provides an analysis of the use of NIR (700–2500nm) spectrometer for measuring macro- and micronutrients in leaf tissues. It firstly discusses the history of NIRS in agriculture and the principle of NIRS in estimating leaf nutrient content. The review then discusses factors that influence the effectiveness of NIR spectra in estimating leaf macro- and micronutrient contents: sample preparation, the spectral range used, pre-processing and multivariate analysis methods, and conditions of application. Key findings are: (1) macronutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu) can be predicted accurately using NIRS, (2) macronutrients are better predicted compared to micronutrients, (3) NIRS can detect macronutrients such as N, P, and S directly because they are major constituents of NIR-sensitive organic compounds, whereas micronutrients and macronutrients that exist mostly in inorganic forms such as Ca, Mg, and K are detected through association with organic compounds and indirect correlations with organic compounds, (4) dried and ground samples result in a better calibration compared to fresh leaf samples due to the standardization of moisture and particle size, (5) Partial least squares regression (PLSR) yields better model accuracy and robustness compared to other linear regression methods, (6) there are not many studies that use machine learning methods for calibration, and (7) NIRS performed better in a laboratory condition compared to field conditions due to interfering external factors such as moisture, temperature, solar radiation and leaf orientation. The overall review suggests that there is a great potential for the field application of NIRS to be used for in situ nutrient analysis of plant leaf tissue.},

Enet and SPLS can perform variable selection and model calibration simultaneously. And they also tend to select wavelength intervals rather than individual wavelengths when the predictors are multicollinear. In this paper, we focus on comparison of Enet and SPLS in interval wavelength selection and model calibration for near infrared spectroscopy data. The results from both simulation and real spectroscopy data show that Enet method tends to select less predictors as key variables than SPLS; thus it gets more parsimony model and brings advantages for model interpretation. SPLS can obtain much lower mean square of prediction error (MSE) than Enet. So SPLS is more suitable when the attention is to get better model fitting accuracy. The above conclusion is still held when coming to performing the strongly correlated NIR spectroscopy data whose predictors present group structures, Enet exhibits more sparse property than SPLS, and the selected predictors (wavelengths) are segmentally successive.},

Soil total nitrogen (TN) and total carbon (TC) are important fertility parameters that can be measured with on-line (mobile) visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy. This study compares the performance of local farm scale calibrations with those based on the spiking of selected local samples from both fields into an European dataset for TN and TC estimation using three modelling techniques, namely gradient boosted machines (GBM), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forests (RF). The on-line measurements were carried out using a mobile, fiber type, vis-NIR spectrophotometer (305–2200 nm) (AgroSpec from tec5, Germany), during which soil spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode from two fields in the UK. After spectra pre-processing, the entire datasets were then divided into calibration (75%) and prediction (25%) sets, and calibration models for TN and TC were developed using GBM, ANN and RF with leave-one-out cross-validation. Results of cross-validation showed that the effect of spiking of local samples collected from a field into an European dataset when combined with RF has resulted in the highest coefficients of determination (R2) values of 0.97 and 0.98, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.01% and 0.10%, and the highest residual prediction deviations (RPD) of 5.58 and 7.54, for TN and TC, respectively. Results for laboratory and on-line predictions generally followed the same trend as for cross-validation in one field, where the spiked European dataset-based RF calibration models outperformed the corresponding GBM and ANN models. In the second field ANN has replaced RF in being the best performing. However, the local field calibrations provided lower R2 and RPD in most cases. Therefore, from a cost-effective point of view, it is recommended to adopt the spiked European dataset-based RF/ANN calibration models for successful prediction of TN and TC under on-line measurement conditions.},

  abstract = {<p>The ability to detect diseased trees before symptoms emerge is key in forest health management because it allows for more timely and targeted intervention. The objective of this study was to develop an in-field approach for early and rapid detection of beech leaf disease (BLD), an emerging disease of American beech trees, based on supervised classification models of leaf near-infrared (NIR) spectral profiles. To validate the effectiveness of the method we also utilized a qPCR-based protocol for the quantification of the newly identified foliar nematode identified as the putative causal agent of BLD, <italic>Litylenchus crenatae</italic> ssp. <italic>mccannii</italic> (LCM). NIR spectra were collected in May, July, and September of 2021 and analyzed using support vector machine and random forest algorithms. For the May and July datasets, the models accurately predicted pre-symptomatic leaves (highest testing accuracy = 100%), but also accurately discriminated the spectra based on geographic location (highest testing accuracy = 90%). Therefore, we could not conclude that spectral differences were due to pathogen presence alone. However, the September dataset removed location as a factor and the models accurately discriminated pre-symptomatic from naïve samples (highest testing accuracy = 95.9%). Five spectral bands (2,220, 2,400, 2,346, 1,750, and 1,424 nm), selected using variable selection models, were shared across all models, indicating consistency with respect to phytochemical induction by LCM infection of pre-symptomatic leaves. Our results demonstrate that this technique holds high promise as an in-field diagnostic tool for BLD.</p>},

A stacked regression ensemble approach using near infrared spectroscopic method was developed for the quantitative determination of glucan, xylan, lignin, ash, and extract in biomass feedstocks. A comprehensive comparison of the performance of various machine learning techniques including support vector regression (linear and radial), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge regression, elastic net, partial least squares, random forests, recursive partitioning and regression trees, gradient boosting, and gaussian process regression was assessed in the training set data (n = 188). The predictive performance of the aforementioned machine learning approaches was then compared with stacked regression, an ensemble learning algorithm which collates the performance of the abovementioned machine learning regression techniques. Results show that the stacked regression primarily outperformed other machine learning techniques (Root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)average=1.660%wt,R2=0.907) across all five constituents in the validation set data (n = 81). Further results also show that the RMSEP of the stacked ensemble technique is significantly different than that of the partial least squares (PLS) approach in predicting glucan, ash, lignin, and extract components in biomass samples. The stacked ensemble learning approach offers an alternative method for a more accurate prediction of biomass compositions than the traditional PLS technique.},

  abstract  = {Infrared spectroscopy has important applications in fields such as materials analysis and chemical detection, while baseline correction is a key step in ensuring the accurate interpretation of spectral data. Uncorrected baselines can lead to deviations in absorption peaks, which affects the accuracy of both quantitative and qualitative analysis. When the absorption peaks of various components in a mixed gas overlap, the lack of reference baseline information in the continuous absorption band can result in significant errors during the baseline correction process. In this paper, we propose a relative absorbance-based independent component analysis (RA-ICA) algorithm to address this challenge. The algorithm first calculates the relative absorbance spectrum that excludes baseline information. Subsequently, based on the Beer-Lambert law and independent component analysis, it extracts independent components containing the absorption peak information of the components, allowing for fitting spectra that require baseline correction. Finally, a baseline model that combines polynomial curves and residuals is used to reconstruct the hidden baseline of the absorption band. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the baseline reconstructed using the RA-ICA method exhibits a significantly lower error compared to five other commonly used baseline correction methods and accurately preserves the detailed characteristics of the baseline.},

  abstract       = {Vegetation indices (VIs) related to plant greenness have been studied extensively for the remote detection of foliar nitrogen content. Yet, the potential of chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) and photoprotection-based indices such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) or the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) for the detection of a wide range of nutrients remains elusive. We measured the dynamics of foliar macro- and micronutrient contents in potato plants as affected by fertilization and water stress, along with leaf and canopy level observations of spectral reflectance and ChlF (or solar-induced fluorescence). ChlF and photoprotection-related indices were more strongly related to a wide range of foliar nutrient contents compared to greenness-based indices. At the leaf level, relationships were largely mediated by foliar chlorophyll contents (Cab) and leaf morphology, which resulted in two contrasting groupings: a group dominated by macronutrients N, P, K, and Mg that decreased during canopy development and was positively correlated with Cab, and a group including Cu, Mn, Zn, and S that increased and was negatively related to Cab. At the canopy-level, spectral indices were additionally influenced by canopy structure, and so their capacity to detect foliar nutrient contents depends on the spatiotemporal covariation between foliar Cab, morphology, and canopy structure within the observations.},

  abstract               = {Potato is the world's fourth largest food crop. Due to limited arable land and an ever-increasing demand for food from a growing population, it is critical to increase crop yields on existing acreage. Soil salinization is an increasing problem that dramatically impacts crop yields and restricts the growing area of potato. One possible solution to this problem is the development of salt-tolerant transgenic potato cultivars. In this work, we review the current potato planting distribution and the ways in which it overlaps with salinized land, in addition to covering the development and utilization of potato salt-tolerant cultivars. We also provide an overview of the current progress toward identifying potato salt tolerance genes and how they may be deployed to overcome the current challenges facing potato growers.},

  abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between soil reflectance in the solar domain (400–2500 nm) and soil moisture. Ten soils covering a large range of composition have been sampled. To decrease the large dimensionality of the data set, we reduced the number of wavebands investigated thanks to a simple stepwise linear regression. Seven wavebands were selected, which represent the whole spectral domain for the 10 soils and all moisture conditions with a root mean square error (RMSE) better than 0.002, close to the experimental uncertainties. Each soil reflectance spectrum was normalized by the corresponding reflectance spectrum observed under the driest condition. This allows to minimize effects due to soil type, as well as those of other undesirable multiplicative factors such as roughness and measurement configuration. The relationship between the normalized soil reflectance and moisture was then investigated. For all the wavelengths and all the soils, results show that for low soil moisture levels, the reflectance decreased when the moisture increased. Conversely, after a critical point, soil reflectance increased with soil moisture. For some soils, the reflectance of the wettest conditions can overpass that of the driest conditions. The position of the critical point was related to soil hydrodynamic properties. For both low and high soil moisture levels, and the seven wavelengths selected, the relative reflectance was strongly correlated with moisture. Adjustment of the relationships over individual soil types provides better soil moisture retrieval performances. It also shows that the relationships are generally nonlinear. These results are discussed with regards to the underlying physical processes, as well as for application to soil moisture estimates from reflectance measurements.},

  abstract       = {Excessive use of animal manure as fertilizers can lead to pollution through the introduction of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other mineral compounds to the environment. Wet chemical analytical methods are traditionally used to determine the precise chemical composition of manure to manage the application of animal waste to the soil. However, such methods require significant resources to carry out the processes. Affordable, rapid, and accurate methods of analyses of various chemical components present in animal manure, therefore, are valuable in managing soil and mitigating water pollution. In this study, a stacked regression ensemble approach using near-infrared spectroscopy was developed to simultaneously determine the amount of dry matter, total ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, and potassium oxide contents in both cattle and poultry manure collected from livestock production areas in France and Reunion Island. The performance of the stacked regression, an ensemble learning algorithm that is formed by collating the well-performing models for prediction was then compared with that of various other machine learning techniques, including support vector regression (linear, polynomial, and radial), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression, elastic net, partial least squares, random forests, recursive partitioning and regression trees, and boosted trees. Results show that stack regression performed optimally well in predicting the seven abovementioned chemical constituents in the testing set and may provide an alternative to the traditional partial least squares method for a more accurate and simultaneous method in determining the chemical properties of animal manure.},
